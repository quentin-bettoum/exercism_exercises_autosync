# Leap

Welcome to Leap on Exercism's Crystal Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Introduction

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

- In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
- Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:

- 1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
- 1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
- 2000 was a leap year!

## Instructions

Your task is to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

There are various ways to solve **leap**, this exercise focuses on not using the built-in `Time.leap_year?` method.
This is because the goal of this exercise is to learn about dealing with comparisons and boolean logic.
But for any other purpose, it is recommended to use the built-in method.
